# SCS-Project

**Requirement**<br />
The subject of this project is developing a program that controls laser cutting machine.
The program reads a file that contains the cutting trajectory as a sequence of segments and arcs and generates commands for bi-directional movements (x,y) of the cutting edge. The movement of the cutting edge will be simulated on the computer screen.

**Chosen approach**<br />
I've chosen C/C++ language to develop the application along with the SDL 2.0 library to implement the graphic simulation.
